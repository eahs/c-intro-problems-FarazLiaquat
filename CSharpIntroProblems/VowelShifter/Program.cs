/*
 * Vowel Shifter
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user for a sentence and modifies it by shifting each vowel like this:
 *      • a → e             A → E
 *      • e → i             E → I
 *      • i → o             I → O
 *      • o → u             O → U
 *      • u → a             U → A
 *
 * In other words, each "a" in the original sentence becomes an "e", each "e" in the original sentence
 * becomes an "i", and so on, and similarly for capital letters.
 *
 * The following test cases illustrate the required I/O format.
 *
 * Enter a sentence: Your powers are weak, old man!
 * Yuar puwirs eri wiek, uld men!
 *
 * Enter a sentence: I find your lack of faith disturbing.
 * O fond yuar leck uf feoth dostarbong.
 *
 * Enter a sentence: I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
 * O cen teki yua es fer es Enchurhied.
 *
 * As shown by the third test case, capitalized vowels may appear anywhere within the input sentence.
